Nadaraya-Watson Regression

Nadaraya-Watos (NW) regression learns a non-linear function by using a kernel-
weighted average of the data. Fitting NW can be done in closed-form and is
typically very fast. However, the learned model is non-sparse and thus suffers
at prediction-time.

TALK ABOUT EFFICIENT LOOCV!!

This example illustrates NW on an artificial dataset, which
consists of a sinusoidal target function and strong noise added to every fifth
datapoint.
