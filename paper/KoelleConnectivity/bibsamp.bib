              through its output projections to target areas. The primary (MOp)

              output projections that are targeted to both similar and
              different target areas. These projections are further divided
              into layer 5 and 6 neuronal outputs, thereby producing four

  abstract = "This paper develops a frequentist model averaging method based on
              the leave-subject-out cross-validation. This method is applicable
              not only to averaging longitudinal data models, but also to
              averaging time series models which can have heteroscedastic
              errors. The resulting model averaging estimators are proved to be
              asymptotically optimal in the sense of achieving the lowest
              possible squared errors. Both simulation study and empirical
              example show the superiority of the proposed estimators over
              their competitors.",
