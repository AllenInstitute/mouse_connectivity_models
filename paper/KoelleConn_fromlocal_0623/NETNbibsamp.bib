%               understanding inter- and intraregion information processing.
%               Models of structural connectivity are typically constructed and
%               analyzed with the assumption that regions are homogeneous. We
%               instead use the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas to construct
%               a model of whole-brain connectivity at the scale of 100 $\mu$m
%               voxels. The data consist of 428 anterograde tracing experiments
%               in wild type C57BL/6J mice, mapping fluorescently labeled
%               neuronal projections brain-wide. Inferring spatial connectivity
%               with this dataset is underdetermined, since the approximately 2
%               $\times$ 105 source voxels outnumber the number of experiments.
%               To address this issue, we assume that connection patterns and
%               strengths vary smoothly across major brain divisions. We model
%               the connectivity at each voxel as a radial basis kernel-weighted
%               average of the projection patterns of nearby injections. The
%               voxel model outperforms a previous regional model in predicting
%               held-out experiments and compared with a human-curated dataset.
%               This voxel-scale model of the mouse connectome permits
%               researchers to extend their previous analyses of structural
%               connectivity to much higher levels of resolution, and it allows
%               for comparison with functional imaging and other datasets.",
