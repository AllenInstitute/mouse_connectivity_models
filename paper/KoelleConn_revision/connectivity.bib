               choosing the optimal number and positions of knots is a complex
               task. Equidistant knots can be used, but their small and
               discrete number allows only limited control over smoothness and
               fit. We propose to use a relatively large number of knots and a
               difference penalty on coefficients of adjacent B-splines. We
               show connections to the familiar spline penalty on the integral
               of the squared second derivative. A short overview of B-splines,
               of their construction and of penalized likelihood is presented.
               We discuss properties of penalized B-splines and propose various
               criteria for the choice of an optimal penalty parameter.

              non-overlapping projection areas of these cell groups: for
              instance, DR (B7) projects to basal parts of the forebrain, such
              as the amygdala, whereas MR (B8) is the main 5-HT source to the

              output projections that are targeted to both similar and

              brain axonal projection atlas of the C57Bl/6J mouse brain.
              Anatomical trajectories throughout the brain were mapped into a
              common 3D space using a standardized platform to generate a
              comprehensive and quantitative database of inter-areal and
              cell-type-specific projections. This connectivity atlas has
              several desirable features, including brain-wide coverage,
              validated and versatile experimental techniques, a single
              standardized data format, a quantifiable and integrated
              neuroinformatics resource, and an open-access public online
              database (http://connectivity.brain-map.org/). Meaningful
              informatics data quantification and comparison is key to
              effective use and interpretation of connectome data. This relies
              on successful definition of a high fidelity atlas template and
              framework, mapping precision of raw data sets into the 3D
              reference framework, accurate signal detection and quantitative
              connection strength algorithms, and effective presentation in an
              integrated online application. Here we describe key informatics
              pipeline steps in the creation of the Allen Mouse Brain
              Connectivity Atlas and include basic application use cases.",

              areas. Successful integration of these data requires a standard
              3D reference atlas. Here, we present the Allen Mouse Brain Common
              Coordinate Framework (CCFv3) as such a resource. We constructed
              an average template brain at 10 $\mu$m voxel resolution by
              interpolating high resolution in-plane serial two-photon
              tomography images with 100 $\mu$m z-sampling from 1,675 young
              adult C57BL/6J mice. Then, using multimodal reference data, we
              parcellated the entire brain directly in 3D, labeling every voxel
              with a brain structure spanning 43 isocortical areas and their
              layers, 329 subcortical gray matter structures, 81 fiber tracts,
              and 8 ventricular structures. CCFv3 can be used to analyze,
              visualize, and integrate multimodal and multiscale datasets in 3D
              and is openly accessible (https://atlas.brain-map.org/).",

  abstract = "Comprehensive knowledge of the brain's wiring diagram is
              fundamental for understanding how the nervous system processes
              information at both local and global scales. However, with the
              singular exception of the C. elegans microscale connectome, there
              are no complete connectivity data sets in other species. Here we
              report a brain-wide, cellular-level, mesoscale connectome for the
              mouse. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas uses enhanced
              green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing adeno-associated
              viral vectors to trace axonal projections from defined regions
              and cell types, and high-throughput serial two-photon tomography
              to image the EGFP-labelled axons throughout the brain. This
              systematic and standardized approach allows spatial registration
              of individual experiments into a common three dimensional (3D)
              reference space, resulting in a whole-brain connectivity matrix.
              A computational model yields insights into connectional strength
              distribution, symmetry and other network properties. Virtual
              tractography illustrates 3D topography among interconnected
              regions. Cortico-thalamic pathway analysis demonstrates
              segregation and integration of parallel pathways. The Allen Mouse
              Brain Connectivity Atlas is a freely available, foundational
              resource for structural and functional investigations into the
