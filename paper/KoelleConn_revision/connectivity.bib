               choosing the optimal number and positions of knots is a complex

               discrete number allows only limited control over smoothness and
               fit. We propose to use a relatively large number of knots and a
               difference penalty on coefficients of adjacent B-splines. We
               show connections to the familiar spline penalty on the integral
               of the squared second derivative. A short overview of B-splines,
               of their construction and of penalized likelihood is presented.
               We discuss properties of penalized B-splines and propose various

              a major task in the development of safe and efficient gene
              therapy protocols. Recombinant adenovirus is an attractive vector
              because it can be prepared in huge quantity and new generation
              vectors possess very large cloning capacities combined with
              reduced immunogenicity. In the brain, adenovirus transduces
              mainly glial cells, making it difficult to use this vector system
              in applications that need expression of therapeutic proteins in
              neurons. Here, we show that by using a small fragment of the
              human synapsin 1 gene promoter, we were able to restrict
              transgene expression from an adenoviral vector exclusively to
              neurons. Furthermore, we obtained stable long-term transgene
              expression from this vector in striatum and thalamus at

              relatively neuron specific, it still expressed in glial cells
              also, and was clearly outperformed by the synapsin promoter with
              respect to transcriptional neuronal targeting. As an important
              feature of adenoviral-mediated gene transfer to the brain, we
              demonstrate that dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra do
              not allow for long-term expression from adenoviral vectors.

              contextual (or ecologic) data may constitute an appropriate
              alternative to individual socioeconomic characteristics. Indices
              can be used to summarize the multiple dimensions of the
              neighborhood socioeconomic status. This work proposes a
              statistical procedure to create a neighborhood socioeconomic
              index. METHODS: The study setting is composed of three French
              urban areas. Socioeconomic data at the census block scale come
              from the 1999 census. Successive principal components analyses
              are used to select variables and create the index. Both
              metropolitan area-specific and global indices are tested and
              compared. Socioeconomic categories are drawn with hierarchical
              clustering as a reference to determine ``optimal'' thresholds
              able to create categories along a one-dimensional index. RESULTS:
              Among the twenty variables finally selected in the index, 15 are
              common to the three metropolitan areas. The index explains at
              least 57\% of the variance of these variables in each
              metropolitan area, with a contribution of more than 80\% of the
              15 common variables. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed procedure is
              statistically justified and robust. It can be applied to multiple
              geographical areas or socioeconomic variables and provides
              meaningful information to public health bodies. We highlight the

              details of the BF are not well understood due to the anatomical

              basalocortical connections reflect cortical connectivity
              patterns. Distinct retrograde tracers were deposited into various
              frontal and posterior cortical areas, and retrogradely labeled
              cholinergic and noncholinergic neurons were mapped in the BF.
              Concurrently, we mapped retrogradely labeled cells in posterior
              cortical areas that project to various frontal areas, and all
              cell populations were combined in the same coordinate system. Our
              studies suggest that the cholinergic and noncholinergic

              organized into segregated or overlapping pools of projection

              data makes it a challenge to extract biological information. We
              developed staNMF, a method that combines a scalable
              implementation of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with a
              new stability-driven model selection criterion. When applied to a

              principal patterns (PP). Providing a compact yet biologically
              interpretable representation ofDrosophilaexpression patterns, PP
              are comparable to a fate map generated experimentally by laser

              output projections that are targeted to both similar and
              different target areas. These projections are further divided
              into layer 5 and 6 neuronal outputs, thereby producing four

              Biotinylated dextran amine injected into the primary AC (AI) or
              anterior auditory field (AAF) of mice produced large,
              ``driver-type'' terminals primarily in the MGBd, with essentially

              coincided with retrogradely labeled layer 6 cell bodies. After

              Anatomical trajectories throughout the brain were mapped into a
              common 3D space using a standardized platform to generate a
              comprehensive and quantitative database of inter-areal and
              cell-type-specific projections. This connectivity atlas has
              several desirable features, including brain-wide coverage,
              validated and versatile experimental techniques, a single
              standardized data format, a quantifiable and integrated
              neuroinformatics resource, and an open-access public online
              database (http://connectivity.brain-map.org/). Meaningful
              informatics data quantification and comparison is key to
              effective use and interpretation of connectome data. This relies
              on successful definition of a high fidelity atlas template and
              framework, mapping precision of raw data sets into the 3D
              reference framework, accurate signal detection and quantitative
              connection strength algorithms, and effective presentation in an
              integrated online application. Here we describe key informatics
              pipeline steps in the creation of the Allen Mouse Brain

              areas. Successful integration of these data requires a standard

              Coordinate Framework (CCFv3) as such a resource. We constructed
              an average template brain at 10 $\mu$m voxel resolution by
              interpolating high resolution in-plane serial two-photon
              tomography images with 100 $\mu$m z-sampling from 1,675 young
              adult C57BL/6J mice. Then, using multimodal reference data, we
              parcellated the entire brain directly in 3D, labeling every voxel
              with a brain structure spanning 43 isocortical areas and their
              layers, 329 subcortical gray matter structures, 81 fiber tracts,
              and 8 ventricular structures. CCFv3 can be used to analyze,
              visualize, and integrate multimodal and multiscale datasets in 3D

  abstract = "Comprehensive knowledge of the brain's wiring diagram is
              fundamental for understanding how the nervous system processes
              information at both local and global scales. However, with the
              singular exception of the C. elegans microscale connectome, there
              are no complete connectivity data sets in other species. Here we
              report a brain-wide, cellular-level, mesoscale connectome for the
              mouse. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas uses enhanced
              green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing adeno-associated
              viral vectors to trace axonal projections from defined regions
              and cell types, and high-throughput serial two-photon tomography
              to image the EGFP-labelled axons throughout the brain. This
              systematic and standardized approach allows spatial registration
              of individual experiments into a common three dimensional (3D)
              reference space, resulting in a whole-brain connectivity matrix.
              A computational model yields insights into connectional strength
              distribution, symmetry and other network properties. Virtual
              tractography illustrates 3D topography among interconnected
              regions. Cortico-thalamic pathway analysis demonstrates
              segregation and integration of parallel pathways. The Allen Mouse
              Brain Connectivity Atlas is a freely available, foundational
              resource for structural and functional investigations into the
              neural circuits that support behavioural and cognitive processes
